# Data

Data folder holds raw data that is used to enrich the web-app. These data are generally loaded just once either on deployment (Docker) or on build (npm) or in-memory along with the app itself on start. For now we have
- Geographical data (geojson)
- Some data-sets for tags in different languages. These data-sets are in different formats and shapes (maybe it would be good to unify structures in the future)
- Translation models (ML prediction models)
- Translations
