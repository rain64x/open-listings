  Search either the whole listings or by section. There is no way to search explicitly by section, user just need to be on a section listings page. Search looks for similar terms in titles, description and tags of listings.

  Search shows only non "deactivated" and "approved" listings.

  Search can be multi-lingual in case user keywords were in any language and that results with that language are empty. Results should be labeled "multi-lingual search" to remove confusion.
