  Home page is a listings page that is somehow special. It shall expose all or most inputs like subscription and login, search by text, search by geolocation, post a new listing, etc. A lot of fresh data is already presented, not like a minimal commercial one page.

  Even if charged (or supercharged), It shall favor the most valuable content to the user. Valuable content is like:
  - Popular listings
  - New listings

  If user is logged in, valuable content is more narrowed to user's interesets like favorite sections, favorite listings, subscribed to topics etc.
