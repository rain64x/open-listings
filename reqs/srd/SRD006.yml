  Components are HTML inputs that go together to fulfill some functionality. Normally there is only one component per task across pages and user sessions; ie. no two components of two versions diplayed for two users or so. If one component rely on some front-end library and there is a complete technical evolution, it is the same last component which will be displayed for the latest version
