# Client

Client folder holds JavaScript sources that are loaded on client end (browser)
- It is separated by functionalities into different sub-folders
- Functionalities might be logical like: "messaging" functionality, or by library like "Leaflet" for maps, "Notyf" for notifications etc
- There are no client tests for now. Unit tests are good to spot errors and possibly scale. Other tests which are easier to set like Google's Lighthouse or Microsoft's Playwright are also a good addition
